<h1>Baseball Statistics</h1>

<p class="lead"> This project is to display the baseball statistics table of 
the players who played in the year 1998</p>

To achieve the pagination, sorting and searching functionality without reloading the page
we need the usage of javascript libraries like jquery.

To parse the xml, we need xml parsers like Nokogiri.



At this point, this is still incomplete:

1)Calculating the statistics using the formulae and appending them.<br />
2)Need to tweak my bootstrap gem installation a bit to render pagination and sort layout.<br />
3)Setting the default sort
